Hello, my name is **Kaustav Ghosh** and I'm a **Software Engineer** from India. Currently, I'm working at [Tonbo Imaging](https://tonboimaging.com). I am passionate about **Android Open Source Project** and **Linux Kernel**. Over the past few years, I have also worked on **web and mobile application development**. 

Currently, I am based out of Vilnius, Lithuania.

In my spare time you'll find me watching football matches (a big fan of FC Barcelona), listening to music and playing video games. I can speak in English, Bengali and Hindi.

Earlier, I was working for [Tata Consultancy Services](https://www.tcs.com/) and was interning at [Confirmtkt](https://www.confirmtkt.com/). 

In case you were wondering, the profile photo was captured from one of the thermal cameras which we have built at Tonbo Imaging.
