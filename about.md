My name is **Kaustav Ghosh** and I'm a **Software Engineer** from India, currently working at [Tonbo Imaging](https://tonboimaging.com). I am passionate about **Android Open Source Project** and **Linux Kernel**. Over the past few years, I have also worked on _web and mobile application development_. 

I have deep understanding about **linux mobile display subsystem**, **linux input subsystem** and **android boot process**. I love to use `Java`, but admire the power of `C`.

In my spare time you'll find me watching football matches (big fan of _FC Barcelona_), listening to music and playing video games. I can speak in English, Bengali and Hindi.

Earlier, I was working for [Tata Consultancy Services](https://www.tcs.com/) and was interning at [Confirmtkt](https://www.confirmtkt.com/). 

Feel free to [email](mailto:kaustav.ghosh28@gmail.com) me with any questions or comments.
